const mse_project = 'Minecraft Social Experiments is a project I started that conducts fun psychological experiments in video games. I program the experiments in Java, and after inviting 100 players to participate (usually ages 16 - 32), I host the experiment while recording the results. After the event is concluded, I make a video documenting the results, and post it on YouTube. I\'m very proud to say that MSE community has grown remarkably since it\'s start in 2022.'
