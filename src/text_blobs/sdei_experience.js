const sdei_experience_long = 'As a Co-inventor of the "Conversational AI Talent Acquisition System" (patent-pending), I was responsible for the development and launch of a cloud-native NLP conversational recruiting product using React and GCP. I developed recognition and classification models using Google Vertex and Python, which improved some of our core algorithmâ€™s efficiency by 20%. I temporarily served as the Engineering Lead, leading the team from MVP to Beta and automating the back-end FaaS and customer-facing product pages using React. Additionally, I assisted Principal Engineers in optimizing algorithm speed, resulting in an average improvement of 5-6x. With the oversight of a Senior Data Engineer, I developed monitoring and analytics for internal product teams using React, Flask, and GCP. I also managed the team Git repository, controlling versioning and handling pull requests from fellow engineers.'
